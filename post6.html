        <h1 class="post-h1">User Accounts</h1>
        <h2 class="post-h2">What?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            User accounts are basically a grouping of information tied to a particular person or entity. Most times
            accounts are also specific to a particular online activity. Their usage ranges greatly and almost always
            depends on the site or service the account is with. For example, a bank might have a website and a customer
            at the bank could have an account on the website. This type of account might have the ability to view
            information about that person’s finances, allow them to make payments, or sign up for a credit card. That
            same person might also have an account with Instagram which allows them to make posts or interact with other
            posts. However, these two accounts are not related to each other except by the user. But it does not matter
            what the account is for it will still serve as a secure link to that user’s associated information. That
            leads us to the most important part about user accounts: security. These accounts must be secure especially
            if they contain private information. On the users end they are often secured by a password which is created
            by the user and not given to anyone else. However, most account management systems hash the password.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Why?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            As people’s identities are becoming more related to their internet activity, user accounts have emerged as a
            necessity especially if your site requires private or sensitive information to function. Even if your site
            does not include private information including accounts could provide an added amenity to the site. For
            example, if you are making a website that hosts free small minigames user accounts are not necessary. But
            allowing the users to sign in and keep track of their high score and receive virtual rewards provides the
            user with a source of competition and will encourage them to come back to the site.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">How?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            When adding user accounts to your site there are two things you need to get started. First, you will need
            some sort of database. Second, you will need a way to access the database from your site. When creating
            accounts, you can choose to let the user create their own username/id or create one for them. But either way
            usernames should be unique so it can be used as a primary key. The user should also create a password which
            will be hashed, and the hashed version is what should be saved in the database. This is the minimum you need
            for the database, but you should include any other information related to the site.
        </p>
        <p class="post-p">
            The code below is my example of making a JavaScript fetch call to log in. The code will send the username (primary key)
            and password to the login endpoint in the app.js file. The login endpoint will check if the hashed password
            corresponds with the username and return the information associated with the account in the form of the
            object if the password is correct. If not, then the endpoint will return false.
        </p>

            <pre class="post-pre-code">
                <code class="post-code">
function login() {
    fetch(`https://example.com/login/${username}/${password}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            if(data==false){
                alert("Incorrect password");
            }else{
                userInfo=data;
            }
        });
