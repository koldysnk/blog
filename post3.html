        <h1 class="post-h1">Web Transactions</h1>
        <h2 class="post-h2">What?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Web transactions are probably one of the most common ways businesses can make money online. As a customer
            making web transactions seem very simple and easy. To the user, they appear as a simple form in which one
            would fill out their credit card information and billing address. Sometimes if the transaction includes a
            delivery of a physical product there may be a second form for the customer’s delivery address. However, web
            transactions are much more than just two forms below the surface. A web transaction using the third-party
            merchant Google Pay exhibits the following structure. First, the user would click the Google Pay button
            which would display a list of supported payment methods. It will also display any of the payment methods
            currently saved with the customer’s google account. All of the payment information is stored on Google’s
            server side, so when the user confirms a payment a token is sent back to the website. The token includes all
            the necessary information to complete the payment. The website would then send the token and the details
            about the purchase to its backend. The backend then sends the token to the payment provider and uses the
            purchase details to perform any logistical actions needed to ensure the customer will receive their product.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Why?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            To make money of course! While web transactions are not the only way to make money through your website, it
            is the most obvious especially if you are selling a product. Two other methods include hosting
            advertisements and selling data. However, both of these other methods require a lot of traffic and won’t
            help you if you are trying to sell a product. Web transactions can also help a business owner increase their
            customer count drastically. For example, if you are a local artist and sell art out of your garage then your
            customers are limited by your location. This means only people who live near you would have a chance of
            learning about your business and potentially buying a piece of art. But as soon as you make a website,
            people from all over the world can learn about your business. However, without some sort of web
            transactions, they still will not be able to buy your products easily. As soon as you add web transactions,
            location no longer matters and people from all over the world can buy your art.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">How?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            There are two main ways of implementing web transactions. First, is through your own merchant account. To
            use this method, you would need to get an approved merchant account from a bank and then build the
            transaction forms from scratch. If you are a small business this option may be too costly as the initial
            setup fees for a merchant account can be high and maintaining the transaction forms may be too time
            consuming. The more popular way is to use a third-party merchant. This option is usually better since the
            setup fees are low to none and most third-party merchants will provide an API. The downside to using a
            third-party merchant is that they will almost always take a small fee from each purchase made.
        </p>
        <p class="post-p">
            For my example I will be referencing the third-party merchant Google Pay. When integrating the functionality
            for the Google Pay API, there are four main steps to follow. First, you must load the JavaScript file that
            allows all the functionality to work (pay.js). Once the file is loaded you must add functionality for the
            isPaymentReady() API call. This function checks to see if the person viewing your page has a valid payment
            method. One thing to note here is that Google suggests not to display the Google Pay button until a valid
            payment method is confirmed. This means the person browsing your site must have an active google account
            already signed in. Once a valid payment method is confirmed the second API call to make is the
            createButton() function. This ensures that all regulations are being met and even provides translations
            based on the user’s location. The final API call is the loadPaymentData() call which opens up the payment
            sheet and performs all the necessary tasks for collecting the payment token details. Once these steps are
            done your web transactions are ready for business. The code excerpt bellow only shows the first step, but a
            link is provided to the rest of the steps.
