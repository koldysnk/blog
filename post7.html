        <h1 class="post-h1">Regular Expressions</h1>
        <h2 class="post-h2">What and Why?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Regular expressions are also known as regexes. They are string representations of patterns that are used to
            identify other strings/patterns. They can be used to check whole strings or characters for matches. In
            almost every situation where regular expressions are used they are used to eliminate the need for multiple
            searches. For example, one of the simplest uses for regular expressions are when a word has multiple
            spellings. If you wanted to perform a search for the word gray/grey without regular expressions you would
            first need to do a search for gray then a search for grey and combine the results. When using regular
            expressions, you only need one search on the regex /gr[ae]y/. This is assuming the regex delimiters are the
            '/' character. Aside from just alphabetic characters, regular expressions can also include numbers and
            symbols. Using regular expressions could be particularly useful during project two as they will help me
            identify words that match letters that have already been guessed.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">How?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            If the regular expression is relatively simple it will look very similar to the string you are looking for.
            However as your target becomes more complicated so will the regular expression. If you want a range in your
            expression you can use the '-' character to indicate one. The regex /[1-9]/ represents a single digit.
            Notice how this regex includes brackets. The brackets indicate that 1-9 part is a range. Now what happens if
            you would like more than one digit. Instead of multiple ranges you could add a quantifier. First is the ‘*’
            character which matches any quantity from zero and above. Next is the '+' character which matches any
            quantity from one and above. Last is the '?' character which matches one or none. Quantifiers can be more
            specific with the braces '{}' character. The regex /[0-9]{3}/ matches a three digit number, /[0-9]{3,5}/
            matches a three to five digit number, and /[0-9]{3,}/ matches a three digit or longer number.
        </p>
        <p class="post-p">
            The following example of regular expressions is using JavaScript. The example takes a string which contains
            any number of words delimited by numbers with any digit length above one. It then splits that string into an
            array of strings where each index is a word.
