        <h1 class="post-h1">CAPTCHAs</h1>
        <h2 class="post-h2">What?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            CAPTCHAs are a type of form element that requests the user perform some type of action. The action can range
            from many different things, but the most common ones ask you to type a specific word that is displayed with
            some type of non-uniform/non-standard style. Another common CAPTCHA asks the user to select images from a
            list of provided images that all contain a certain object. Ideally the action a CAPTCHA asks the user to
            perform would be relatively easy for a human but very difficult for a bot. CAPTCHAs should also provide
            support for users with hearing or seeing disabilities. CAPTCHAs have been around for over 20 years and the
            acronym CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.

        <h2 class="post-h2">Why?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            In the 1990s Altavista was the most commonly used search engine and supported logging websites and their
            links in its database. However, spam became a major problem as there were many people who created bots that
            sent links to Altavistaâ€™s database. To overcome this problem, Altavista created the first CAPTCHA which was
            an image of a set of letters and numbers that was distorted. To submit a link to the database one would need
            to correctly identify the set of letters and numbers. Since image recognition was not as good back then,
            this eliminated the threat of bots posting links. Nowadays, CAPTCHAs are very common and are used wherever a
            public form is recorded that is also not behind some other sort of verification wall like an account login.
            They are used to prevent spam and potentially malicious inputs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">How?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            You could always try and create your own version of a CAPTCHA, but this could be very difficult, unreliable,
            and potentially vulnerable. I would suggest using the reCAPTCHA script provided by Google for free. To use
            tis you first need to register for your key. This includes providing information about your domain and what
            type of CAPTCHA you would like. The public and private keys are provided instantly, and the public key
            should be used in place of publicKey in the code sample. The private key is to be used on your server side
            to verify the CAPTCHA was completed correctly. When implementing the CAPTCHA on your client side there are
            only three code steps needed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="post-p">
            First, you must load in the script.
        </p>
        <div class="div-code">
            <pre class="post-pre-code">
                <code class="post-code">
&lt;script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js">&lt;/script>
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p class="post-p">
            Second, you must have a callback function that handles the token received when the CAPTCHA is completed
            correctly.
        </p>
        <div class="div-code">
            <pre class="post-pre-code">
                <code class="post-code">
&lt;script>
    function onSubmit(token) {
      document.getElementById("demo-form").submit();
    }
&lt;/script>
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p class="post-p">
            Finally, you must include specific tags on your submit button for whatever form you would like to apply the
            CAPTCHA to.
        </p>
        <div class="div-code">
            <pre class="post-pre-code">
                <code class="post-code">
&lt;button class="g-recaptcha" 
    data-sitekey="publicKey" 
    data-callback='onSubmit' 
    data-action='submit'>Submit&lt;/button>
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
