        <h2 class="post-h2">What analytics?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Web analytics are added to a website and are used to track information about the users that visit the
            website and how they interact with the website. Oftentimes, a user will visit a website and not even realize
            that an analytics script is recording information about the interaction. The type of information collected
            can generally be split into two categories. First, information can be collected about what a user does while
            visiting the website. Some examples of this first case include the total time spent on the site, the time
            spent on each page, the order pages were visited, and which internal links were clicked. Second, information
            can be collected about the user itself. Examples of the second case include collecting the geographic
            location of the user, the IP-Address of the user, what browser or operating system their using, and the site
            that referred them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Why analytics?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            As more and more people across the globe are gaining access to the internet, the opportunity for websites to
            make a profit increases as well. Each new person with access is a new potential customer. Now, for websites,
            customers can be anyone from someone who just visits a page and reads a blog post or someone who goes to an
            online store and purchases a product. However, very few of these people would become customers without web
            analytics. Since so many people have access to the internet, millions of websites have been created to fill
            the demand and all of them are competing for customers. If a website isn’t appealing enough, potential
            customers will browse right past it and visit a different site.
        </p>
        <p class="post-p">
            This is where web analytics play a major role. By using analytics, a company can identify important data
            about the users. I write data because most analytics tools do not interpret the data they collect into
            information. The data would need to be collected and interpreted into usable information. If the number of
            users is relatively low, analyzing the data may be able to be done by hand, but as the users grow analysts
            will tend to rely on some sort of machine learning to interpret the data. Once the information is available,
            it can be used to realize why people like the website and why people leave the website, among other things.
            The company would then try to use this information to increase time spent and revisits while removing or
            toning down aspects of the website that are less popular.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">How analytics?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Adding analytics to a website may seem like an overwhelming task for a small developer, but depending on how
            you add the feature, it could only take 15 minutes. One of the most common and easiest ways is to use Google
            Analytics, plus its free. To use Google Analytics, first you must have or create a google account. Next, you
            can create a google analytics account for free. The application process is short and only asks for
            information about what you are tracking and what information you want to share. Once you have an analytics
            account Google will provide you with a code insert resembling the one below. Put the insert inside the head
            tag of each HTML file, upload your site, and you’re good to go!
