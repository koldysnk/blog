        <h1 class="post-h1">Hosting Advertisements</h1>
        <h2 class="post-h2">What?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Advertisements on websites originally started out as solely banner ads. These were not targeted, and
            companies paid to display their ads in lump sums wherever space was available. The first banner ad was sold
            for $30,000 for 3 months and had a click through rate of 44%. Nowadays ads have about .06% click through
            rate. Soon banner ads became more targeted to the customer and were placed on more related sites. Eventually
            pop-up ads became popular but were hated by consumers and are now rarely seen. As ads became more popular
            and smaller sites arose, so did the pay-per-click and pay-per-view payment methods. As the field of
            artificial intelligence and machine learning became more advanced ads became extremely targeted and can even
            use a computers microphone to detect what a user is talking about and provide even more targeted ads.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Why?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            With the transition towards the pay-per-click and pay-per-view payment methods, ads have become more
            available to much smaller companies. Advertisements serve as another form of electronic income for website
            publishers. This means that an online business does not need to sell anything to make some money. Ads also
            allow website publishers to provide their sites to the public for free, while still making money off the
            site. However, ad rates are usually very low averaging around 18 cents per view. As a result, unless your
            site has a significant amount of traffic it may be difficult to generate revenue through ads.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">How?</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Adding advertisements to your website is just as easy as the concepts in the other posts I have made, but
            the process takes a little longer. First you need to create an account with Google Adsense. To do this, you
            will need a working domain name and a payment account with Google. To make it even easier the payment
            account does not even need a card at the time of creation. Once you have your account you will be provided a
            short scrip tag to add to your HTML. The tag must go inside your head tag. Once the tag is added click done
            and the system will look for your script tag. If your tag is incorrectly added to the site after too many
            failed searches you will not be able to submit a request for 24 hours. If Adsense finds your script tag
            Google will begin reviewing your site. This process can take up to 2 weeks to complete, but usually takes a
            couple days.

            Once you are approved you will receive another code block which will allow you to actually display the adds.
            You will also gain the ability to restrict certain ads and edit your payment information. Unfortunately, I
            have not actually been approved yet so there are no ads on this page yet. The code block below is the script
            from the first paragraph.
