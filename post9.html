        <h1 class="post-h1">A Review of CS 347</h1>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Positives</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            The first half of the class when we were talking about the simpler topics was paced perfectly. The videos
            provided enough information so that you could understand the topic and the labs did a good job of
            reinforcing the video lectures while allowing us to apply what we learned. Completing the labs in groups was
            helpful because we were able to think collectively and discuss any problems. The instructions for setting up
            the first project and the blog post were very thorough and very helpful. Most of the time the hardest part
            of a CS project is getting set up and ready to go, so the detailed instructions for the blogs and project 1
            was very appreciated. The midterm also did a good job of allowing us too show what we learned throughout the
            class, but the questions about creating css to recreate the given layouts were kind of weird just because of
            how the images looked in the google doc and how bare bone they were. The weekly blog post is also a good
            idea and should be continued.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Negatives</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            The second half of the class contained much more confusing topics and the videos were helpful but contained
            a lot of information that when packed into short videos makes it difficult to fully understand. This caused
            a lot of people in the class to slack off and not watch the videos. Especially if they had been put in
            groups where one or two members were able to do the lab without the help of the other members. By putting
            off the videos many people did not get even a basic understanding of the topics. Next, the guidelines for
            project two are easy enough to understand if you were able to fully grasp the concepts of the videos.
            However, since the topics were difficult to grasp so was the project 2 rubric. project 2 also did not have
            as detailed of a setup guide which does not promote starting early and lead to lots of confusion when
            setting up the project and a lot of clutter in the droplet and git repository. The nature of the two
            repositories and two subdomains for project 2 was also confusing. Also, because much of the project is based
            on the videos instead of instructions, they are needed for reference when working on the project. However,
            since some of the videos are titled after the mini project created in the video and there are many videos
            finding a particular aspect like using a dispatch function is hard to find. Any time something like this is
            needed you need to skip through many videos to find what you are looking for.
        </p>
        <h2 class="post-h2">Suggestions</h2>
        <p class="post-p">
            Even though the first part of the class was pretty much perfect, it should be condensed to leave more space
            for the second half. The video then lab style should not change for the first part, but should for the
            second part. I think doing live demos instead of the videos and requiring the students to follow along and
            submit their results would be more helpful. Going through the process live would be much more helpful
            because we would be able to immediately resolve problems that come up. Requiring each person to submit
            instead of the group is also useful as it would prevent people from just participating from their phone and
            not really contributing. The live walkthrough could still be more of an attendance thing and you could
            liveshare your code so if someone is a slow typist and needs to copy and paste, they could. Especially since
            writing the code is not necessarily the hard part, but just making sure everything is set up properly is.
            Another suggestion would be to also require individual labs for the second half to reinforce what we went
            over during the live walkthrough. These labs don’t need to be difficult but would be helpful to learn how to
            set the projects up. For project 2 I would suggest providing much more instruction on the workflow and how
            to get started. Because remote hosting and web development stuff is not used in any of the other classes
            offered, more instruction in this class in needed. If the out of class independent labs are made to be more
            difficult then a project 2 might not even be needed. Another take, which would be preferable, would be to
            split project two into pieces in a similar fashion to requiring drafts for an essay. You could start off by
            creating the database and then grade that section. Then move on to creating the endpoints and grade that
            section. Then the actions, then the router portion and so on. By requiring each section to be worked on bit
            by bit and providing a grade it forces us to understand each topic before moving on to the next. Because
            project 2 covers so much more material than project 1 it is much harder to work on every aspect of the
            project together and still understand it. Also by providing a reference document for each section instead of
            just the videos it gives us a more accessible reference point. My last suggestion is to use canvas instead
            of slack. I know you discussed having the materials publicly accessible, but I think it is more valuable to
            have the same structure as the other CS classes. The video lectures should still be available on your
            website as many cs professors here have their own website for lectures and lab materials and everything.
            However, piazza is much better than slack when asking questions and canvas is much better than email for
            storing grades. Canvas is also better for submitting items because it clearly shows us when things are due
            and allows us to download stuff we have already submitted. However, I do understand if crowdsource makes it
            easier for you to check our stuff and there aren’t many things to submit anyways due to the structure of the
            class. Also I know your videos are unlisted, but it would be nice to have a playlist of every video from the
            class. I was planning on making one myself, but future students might appreciate a playlist of the videos
            shown so far.
